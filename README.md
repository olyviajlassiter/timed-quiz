# Module 4: Challenge 4: Create a quiz

This week's challenge allowed us to create a quiz featuring Javascript fundamentals. The user is able to start the game, answer questions, enter their name when they've completed the challenge, and revisit their highscores. If the user gets a question correct, the answer turns green. If the user answers incorrectly, their answer will turn red. In this challenge we combined our working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to create a unique quiz.

<b>The user's story is as follows</b><br>
AS A coding boot camp student<br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores<br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers<br>

<b>The acceptance criteria is as follows</b><br>
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br>
WHEN I click the start button<br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
WHEN I answer a question<br>
THEN I am presented with another question<br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br>
THEN the game is over<br>
WHEN the game is over<br>
THEN I can save my initials and score<br>
